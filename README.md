# PokEditor v3

**Author: Turtleisaac**

Multifunctional in-depth editor for Pokémon Gen IV (4) game data.

Written entirely in Java and is completely OS-agnostic.

**Java 20 is required.** Newer versions may work, but if older classes have been deprecated or removed in those versions, then it may not work for those higher versions of Java.
* The majority of the backend can be found in my other library, [PokEditor-Core](https://github.com/turtleisaac/PokEditor-Core).
* Also powered by my other libraries, [Nds4j](https://github.com/turtleisaac/Nds4j) and [Nds4j-ToolUI](https://github.com/turtleisaac/Nds4j-ToolUI).
* This tool is still in active development and will receive periodic updates as improvements are made and bugs are found, time permitting.
* Please join [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/zAtqJDW2jC) for help with using PokEditor v3 or for help with any questions relating to Pokémon Gen 4 and 5 hacking.
* Currently can be used in English and has partial French and Chinese support.

# Usage

Builds are available in the [Releases page here on GitHub](https://github.com/turtleisaac/PokEditor/releases). Simply download the most recent release, unzip the zip file, and double click the file contained within with the name **PokEditor.jar**!

Unlike prior versions of PokEditor, v3 is intended to fully be used within the tool. No more exporting sheets or editing them elsewhere. Additionally, there is very little effort required by the user to get it set up this time around. No more annoying sheets setup process, it should just automatically load everything into the sheets the instant you open a project.
